# Firefly Grove

This will be a microsite featuring a collection of songs I have written and recorded in the past. The songs can currently be viewed at [fireflygrove.com](http://fireflygrove.com) or on [my Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/davidpots).

With this updated version of the site, I plan to unveil an updated design that will help give me experience working with the Soundcloud API, custom Soundcloud player design, jQuery, and general responsive front-end goodness.

Look for the finished version coming sometime this August.
