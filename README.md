# Firefly Grove

This will be a microsite featuring a collection of songs I have written and recorded in the past. The songs can currently be viewed at [fireflygrove.com](http://fireflygrove.com) or on [my Soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/davidpots).

With this updated version of the site, I plan to unveil an updated design that will help give me experience working with the Soundcloud API, custom Soundcloud player design, jQuery, and general responsive front-end goodness.

Look for the finished version coming sometime this August.

### To do:

- Add animations for the play / pause buttons when pushed (like microbeats.cc)
- if you play the first song before scrolling, show the top player
- Tweak the default non-playing state of the top player (add text, remove timeline, etc)
- Content (Song lyrics): add the "verse #1" stuff, etc
- Content (Song info): add the dates for each song
- Content (Song info): polish the story / write-up for each song
- Add skip/previous controls to top player
- Write / design / code better intro text into the hero
- Tweak the time/duration content (in the time, I want semi-colons instead of periods; remove pipe)
- Top player slide-in animation could be better (something faster, perhaps not slide-in)
- Mobile friendly, please
- Write a blog post about why I built the site
- fit text for the hero h1 (and paragraph?)
- think about a top-player design that retains branding, has external links (if they exist), and a much smaller player
