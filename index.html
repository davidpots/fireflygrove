    <!-- SONG: Hotel Hell -->
    <article class="song">

        <div class="song-info">
          <h1>Hotel Hell</h1>
          <p>In early 2008, one of my favorite blogs would occasionally publish lyrics for song ideas -- some the author recorded as songs, some not. One day while over caffeinated at a coffee shop and having trouble with Photoshop, I saw new lyrics had been posted on this blog for a song named "Hotel Hell".</p>
          <p>Too caffeinated to focus on that day's web design project, I decided to go home and record a spin-off version of the song (which is the kind of thing the author would have loved, I knew). The first verse and chorus were taken from the original lyrics, with the 2nd and 3rd verses being original from me. Within an hour I wrote + recorded the song on my pocket digital recorder.</p>

When I sold the Devil my soul, he got it for half price
I screwed up the paperwork, had to give him my life twice.
But it really was not so bad, it didn't hurt overmuch
Try not to look so sad, and we'll stay right in touch

Greetings from Hotel Hell
Where the weather is hot but all is well
Greetings from Hotel Hell
I'm doing just fine oh can't you tell

Couldn't find a menu at the coffee shop, so I gave the waitress her choice
"Any old tea you can bring to me," were the words that came from my voice
The waitress turned with a devious smile, I learned this after the fact
For her wicked brew stole a piece of my soul, she ain't ever gonna give it back

Greetings from Hotel Hell
Where the weather is hot but all is well
Greetings from Hotel Hell
I'm doing just fine oh can't you tell

Walked on home and feeling pretty low, wicked tea flowing through my veins
Gotta find a way to reverse her curse, and get free of these rusty chains
At that moment I did recall, a piece of chocolate in my sack
Given to me by her fair-skinned twin, it will get me my whole soul back
Eat that cocoa and play a song, a big elk's footprints did say
But you'll have to wander on for 40 odd days, its the price that I have to pay

Greetings from Hotel Hell
Where the weather is hot but all is well
Greetings from Hotel Hell
I'm doing just fine oh can't you tell

          <h1>A Place Called Firefly Grove</h1>
          <p>Coming off the spontaneous creative joy of writing + recording "Hotel Hell" in under an hour, I decided to keep the same restraints and record another song. This next song I wrote, "A Place Called Firefly Grove", was based on the mythology of a creative writing project I had worked on a few years prior and leading up to early 2008. This song was written and recorded probably within a few hours of starting.</p>

It's outside of the village, but it ain't too far
Just above the growing earth, just below the fallin' stars
I'm talking about a place called Firefly Grove
I'll take you there to see it, if with me you will roam

Until we're outside of the village, stay on your tippie-toes
'Cause the Elders wouldn't like it they knew where we were goin'
Not until we've made it 'neath the cover of the trees
Can we shout n' hoot n' hollar just as loud as we please

Hmmm, da da, oh-da-lolly, hum-dee hey
We've made it to the forest, look at us, we're on our way
The pathway to the Grove, it twists and winds
Only way to find it is to follow the signs

Catch a fallin' leaf or hear a whisper in the wind
Spot the red shelled turtle and our journey will begin
Keep your eyes peeled but don't lose your shirt
Or, the Tanglewood Root will tie a knot up in your skirt

We've found the path, we've on our way, we're gettin' real close
A little further and we'll be there, wipe that dirt off of your nose
There's a shortcut to mushrooms and the Burrow just ahead
In Beggar's Canyon never-never land your speeder's painted red

Across the final threshold, what do we have here
A giant meadow, ain't she pretty, better than a phoenix tear
Welcome now, we've made it to Firefly Grove
For a little welcome gift how 'bout a four leaf clove

Forest all around us, tall grass in between
With the Great Tree in the middle, she's the best you'll ever see
The other children of the village have also found their way
They're playing on the tot-lot of root and vine and hay

Quick now, let's play "don't touch the ground"
Jump and hop and hang while making seven silly sounds
Black bird singing with a star for an eye
Supernatural things sounding sweet from the sky

The Deep Forest looks upon us with an ancient gaze
Maybe one day we'll be swallowed by her mystic haze
Listen to the tales of them coming of age
The older ones among us taking lessons from the sage

By themselves into the forest where the path is most dark
To bring back the secret fire and the Arden oak's bark
In a few years, we'll take that journey ourselves
Until that day comes, let's keep our stones up on the shelf

          <p>A comment on the internet made me mad. I decided to write this song to feel better about it. This one is for the people who have it 100% all figured out with absolute certainty, whichever side of the fence they may fall on.</p>

Down in the valley, where the grass has stopped growing
In the empty open plain where you'll find no wind blowing
There lives an old man, just as sharp as a tack
He lives all alone in an old wooden shack

He's got all the answers, there isn't any doubt
There is no solution that he could live without
There's no need for wonder with brains like he's got
He's not even bothered by the things he's forgot

With all his explanations to fend off the fright
You can sure bet your britches he sleeps well at night
The darkness doesn't bother him, nor does old age
He always knows what to expect on the next page

The birds all have left him the clouds have gone by
The color has faded from the berries in his pie
He clings on so tightly to his answers so dear
Laying waste to the mysteries he can't stand to hear

He's been there forever, and forever he'll stay
If you're looking for an answer its your lucky day
Go see him if you want to, he loves his own kind
And please would tell him that I'm doing fine

La la, la la la la...

    <!-- SONG: Roxy Epoxy and the Open Stones -->
    <article class="song">

        <div class="song-info">
          <h1>Roxy Epoxy and the Open Stones</h1>
          <p>The goal with this one was to write a long, sprawling ballad similar to Bob Dylan's "Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts". For a topic, I delve deep back into the stores of the "Firefly Grove" creative writing I'd done. Topically, this explores members of the Spirit Brigade who find themselves on respite in one of the villages of the Deep Forest. One of these Brigadiers, Roxy Epoxy, finds herself inspired by the writing of a special song -- but the villainous Boss Kane wants to usurp her creative act.</p>
          <p>As for inspiration, much of this song was drawn from the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoani_S%C3%A1nchez">Yoani SÃ¡nchez</a>, a Cuban blogger who achieved international fame for her critical portrayal of life in Cuba under its current government. The topic of information flowing freely (to help the people + disempower the bad guys) can be found in the way Roxy shares her song with the people, an act which eventually helps them escape the threat of Boss Kane.</p>

        <div class="song-lyrics">
In the forest deep and wide, in Spirewood, so I hear
There's a little old village named Bindleton, where the air's still fresh and clear
Four roaming Spirit Brigadiers did one day come to town
Wanting nothing more than to relax and lay their troubles down
Roxy Epoxy, Snowden River Jim
Old Hector Handlebar, and Merriweather Slim
Roxy in particular, had one single thing in mind
A song of praise swellin up within, from a well she'd thought long dried

Roxy knew she must take action lest the tune leave her behind
She'd set the song into a magic stone, where its echo she'd always find
But it wouldn't be so easy, or so she'd soon find out
Boss Kane had recently setup shop, his sprawling reach unbound
Roxy Epoxy, I hear you've found a tune
"Won't you lay it down in stone, a great treasure I'll give to you"
"Every market here belongs to me, you really have no choice"
"Otherwise, back to the woods where no one will hear your voice"

Roxy thought this over, quite unsure what to think
She'd visions of a fountain, from which all could freely drink
She knew she must release the song, unbind it, set it free
How was she to do this and keep it out of Boss Kane's reach
She crept into the forest, to lay that sucker down
Set firm inside a polished stone, inside it would resound
She snuck back into town that night, the stone tight in her glove
Boss Kane would surely unleash hell, but Roxy would rise above

She found Rascal Ricardo, he could work a flashy spell
He tapped the stone right to its source, and opened up its shell
She met Yuri Yolipedes, who writes on a secret wall
In less than an hour Roxy's plan was known by all
From pocket to pocket, the song it did pass
Being copied from stone to stone, the melody traveling fast
Boss Kane his stock did plummet, hope flowed through the town,
Roxy had no gold, a different type of treasure she had found

Boss Kane he gathered with his goons outside of the town hall
Villagers approached slowly to see what was to befall
A final showdown coming quick, there wasn't any doubt
Roxy took stage center and Boss Kane said with a shout:
"Roxy Epoxy, all your praise belongs to me!
You'll pay the price for your mistake, and foolish treachery!"
His goons advanced with demon sticks, to beat and steal her soul
Outnumbered and surrounded, she was truly in a hole

Her song alone would be no match, her end seemed to be near
When from all sides sweet music began sounding through the air
Villagers throughout the town, her tune they all did play
Each wieldin' their own song stone, each playin' it their own way
The melody it flanked the goons, taking them aback
The bark stripped from their demon sticks, Roxy knew that she must act
She whirled around her guitar and let ring the secret chord
Quite surprised, as her fingers acted on their own accord
A blaze of brilliance blasted forth, cuttin' through the charging ranks
Their demon sticks snapped clean in two, cleavin' their faces blank

The goons, well they all scattered quick, the town was free once more
The villagers rejoiced at last, thanking Roxy for her chore
Boss Kane did also flee the scene, some say he was never there
He's no doubt back in Sugartown where he rules from his secret lair
And Roxy Epoxy, the hero of our tale
Though she's back in the Deep Forest, that tune it still prevails
She makes no claim to own the song, she merely set it free
Knowing that forever folks can play it as they please

    <!-- SONG: The Hat Man -->
    <article class="song">

        <div class="song-info">
          <h1>The Hat Man</h1>
          <p>This song continues the songwriting project I'd started weeks earlier (giving myself a very tight deadline to write + record). "The Hat Man" pulled freely from the archetype of the Trickster in comparative mythology: a force of disruption, mischief, irreverence, and often chaos that in turn often leads to creation and revitalization. Great fodder for songwriting imagery.</p>

        <div class="song-lyrics">
Well, I was traveling alone in the forest one night
Slowly making my way by the dim lantern light
I was just between two thoughts, you know the sound of one hand clapping
Well, it hit me, and then...

A stranger then appeared with some sparkle in his motion
His many-color coat it flowed like the ocean
With his cane, he rapped on the ground three times
...And do you know what happened?

A magical flask appeared in my grip
I'm not one to argue so I took quite the sip
and swallowed the potion down, it worked its magic

And at that moment I did recall
The reason I was in that forest at all
A memory I'd otherwise forgotten, left behind years ago
I looked up at the stranger and said,

You're the Hat Man, I've heard about you
Being who you are, and doing what they say you do
I offered my kindest thanks, and he just smiled
And kept on walkin' along

He's the Hat Man, travelin far and wide
Spannin' seven leagues with every single stride
Footloose and fancy free
Ramblin' on however he please

The Hat Man travels from town to town
He doesn't seem effected by the ups and downs
He doesn't care for beginnings,
and has got no concerns for endings

He's got bowlers, berets, bucket hats too,
Fedoras, Panamas, he's got a Stetson for you
He's got caps & gowns & scarves & bandanas to boot
That's just scratchin' the surface

Money is not what the Hat Man seeks
He prefers to barter with smiles and winks
He once sold a green fedora for three deep breaths

It ain't really about the trades that he makes,
but rather the good luck he leaves in his wake
For if you see him coming your way, you best crack a smile
Unless you like fightin' the wind, 'cause...

He's the Hat Man, what's he up to now?
Walkin' on water or lougin up in a cloud
Ain't no way to tell just where he's at
Would you look at that, here he comes,

He's the Hat Man, up up and away
Planting them seeds all throughout the day
He's your best friend when you need 'em,
and even when you don't

Everybody get yourselves together
Nevermind the stormy weather
Oh, up on your feet,
Here comes the Hat Man

Now, the Hat Man travels as the Hat Man please
with a crook to his step and a shake in his knee
And no, that was no stumble, he's just dancing
Who do you think we're talking about, here?

He strolls along with his corn-cob pipe
If there was sweat on his brow, he'd give it a wipe
But he doesn't have to. It's not there. He's not sweating

The Hat Man goes where he doesn't want to be seen
And he's seen where he doesn't want to go
But he'll go there just the same

There and back again, and two times more
There's no place he ain't ever been before
When will he be in town next? Just look behind ya.

It's the Hat Man, coming to town
Come on and put your money down!
Let the chips fall where they may,
That's where he wants 'em... yeah you'll see,

He's the Hat Man, arriving today
From over them hills and so far away
Trampled underfoot, nearly forgotten
Yeah, he'll bring that fire back to life, oh!

Everybody get yourselves together
Nevermind the stormy weather
Oh, up on your feet,
Here comes the Hat Man

Rolling thunder, Spirit Train
The rhythm rolls with his refrain
His tune carries on high
into the heavens

Whether loom of the fruit or the fruit of the loom
From the Tomb of the womb to womb of the tomb
The Hat Man, he's traveled on, but not forgotten
not by me, at least

We're hoping real hard he'll be back soon
But no use lookin' at the finger that points at the moon
So we'll carry on his work ourselves
And if he does come back, we'll be ready

Walking through the forest, he was care free and without worry
He found a stone, tossed it up and down through the air
When suddenly his eyes, they're drawn up and there before him
The mighty stump of a tree, fresh cut and sad, laying bare

He slowly drew near, the toss taken out of his pebble
A sorrow within swells forth, upon his eyes the rings
Of the tree that once was, so in its center he lays down the stone
And whips round his guitar, takes a deep breath, and starts to sing

A song for the fallen tree... a song for the live ones
A song for our faded dreams... so new ones may rise again

When his song had all finished, he sat there for a moment, breathing deeply
And there upon the stump, the stone he had left it did glow
The spirit of the tree, roused and livened, it had been released now
Set inside the stone, which he gathered up and went on his go

All of the children of the village, they're all taught the same now
Each with an instrument, set forth into the wild to play
Each goes their own way, toward a tree thats in need of their song now
And let their newly hatched music take flight into the light of day

And from all sides, sweet songs flood back into the village
Melodies joining as one in the center of town
And in the circle garden, behold a new sprout has taken root now
Its secret to be heard, by all those with their ears to the ground

Sing for the fallen trees, sing for the lives one
A song for our faded dreams, so a new one may rise again

Old Chester Wheaton, walking down the avenue
Got a bounce in his step, though there's holes in both his shoes
Not sure where he's going, can't remember where he's been
Yes, with ninety years behind him, he deserves some wine and gin

Oh, let's bounce around like Chester
Down the streets of Sugartown
Drop a coin into his cup
And watch him drink it right on down

Oh, let's take a nap like Chester
In the gutter flowing free
And then swagger down an alley
Graceful stumble, skid your knee

Some say he's addicted... others they call him a bum
But he's just a guy like your or me... whose glass is filled with rum
Oh, he never asks for nothing... yet he seems to do just fine
See, his glass is always full, and yes his smile's always wide

Oh, let's bump the walls with Chester
Walkin' straight and tall's a bore
Yes, when gravity's gone silly
You're allowed to ask for more

Oh, let's live it up with Chester
'Til the closing bells to ring
Then lets keep the party going
Into the forest if need be

Birdsong, early morning rise
One by one, they heed the calling
Round the bend and up the hill they climb
Shadowed trees, graveled footsteps

Through the doors, they each make their own way
No two of them the same, their seats a'taken
A coffeeshop by name, but so much more
For the treasures kept in store, leave pillars shaken

Oh, just to see your face, so inviting
Under warmth of your quilt
In the end, there'll be peace the same
For tomorrow... a return to that cafe on the hill

Firedance, full moon in the sky
Round and round, all drums a'blazing
While under roof, not an empty seat it sight
Smores a'flame, red wine a'flowing

Each conversation, a treasure to behold
While adventures do unfold, from green to red room
Dim corridor with hands traced on the wall
For each who walks these halls, they leaves their mark now

Into the night, the music leads the way
The mic is open, but soon closed be it will
For the end, always comes too soon
'Twould be no different, so it goes for that cafe on the hill

Winter chill, stillness in the air
Seasons pass, hanging over
Grey sky, dashed hopes from here to there
Scattered wide, let down and dazing

Each one of them, they search amidst the blue
For the comfort they once knew, but find no shelter
When tomorrow comes, I'll seek on just the same
Did I really know your name? I sit and wonder

So, it must be sometimes, treasured echoes
Rendered hollow, and so shrill
Even still, does the hope remain, for the promise
Open doors at that cafe on the hill

Her hard work behind her, she needs no reminder

To their voices she listens, full moon hanging high

Ancestor radio, play that sweet music, oh
Melodies heavenly, rhythms sublime
She tunes her receiver, she is a believer
For the broadcasted signal has dropped her a line

Ancestor radio, sing me a song
Through wastelands of static, your signal is strong
Ancestor radio, don't pass me by
Your current it flows, may it never run dry

Antennas all over, smoked leaf of a clover
The whisper of wind, or the bark of a tree
Stones on the mantle, for instance example
There pictured in frame, old eyes looking at me

Ancestor radio, help me to find
The frequency needed, to make your song shine
Ancestor radio, come back my way
I'll suffer the white noise until that fine day

Cool breeze on a hill top, night sky as a backdrop
Firefly glow, in the darkness between
Spirit guitar strumming, can't help but start humming
Tune in for yourself, and you'll hear what I mean
